== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to add Payflex to my store. What do I need to do? =

Please complete the merchant enquiry form or send us an email with your details to grow@payflex.co.za. Our experienced sales team will then give you a call and get you up and running in as little as a day.

= What does Payflex cost? =

Payflex offers a very simple fee structure, with no upfront fees or fees for refunds, failed payments or authorisations. Payflex simply charges a per-transaction fee on successful transactions only. Our Partnership Managers will discuss the details – but our philosophy is keep it simple and transparent.

= What is the minimum contract term? =

We don’t believe in tying our merchants into long-term commitments. We’re in the partnership business and want to work with you to grow your business. If Payflex doesn’t work for you then turn us off.

= What happens if a shopper doesn't pay their Payflex instalments? =

That’s our problem. You get 100% of the purchase amount (less the Payflex fee) paid in full upfront.
